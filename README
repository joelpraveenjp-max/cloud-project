 AWS Cloud Deployment Project

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a cloud-based application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The objective was to design and implement a scalable, secure, and highly available cloud architecture capable of hosting and managing application workloads efficiently.

The system leverages core AWS services to simulate real-world cloud infrastructure used in modern enterprise environments.

 Objectives

* Deploy applications on cloud infrastructure
* Implement scalable and reliable hosting solutions
* Understand cloud networking and storage services
* Apply DevOps and cloud deployment best practices

---
 AWS Services Used

* **Amazon EC2** – Virtual server hosting
* **Amazon S3** – Cloud storage for application assets and data
* **AWS IAM** – Secure access management
* **Security Groups** – Network traffic control
* **Elastic IP** – Public access configuration

---

Architecture Overview

The application is deployed on an EC2 instance configured with required runtime dependencies. Static resources and datasets are stored in Amazon S3, enabling scalable storage and efficient data access.

Users access the application through a public endpoint secured via AWS networking configurations.
